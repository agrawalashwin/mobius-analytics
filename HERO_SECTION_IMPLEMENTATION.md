## Files Created

1. **frontend/components/SalariesHero.tsx** - Main hero component with search, CTAs, stats
2. **frontend/components/ChartSectionIntro.tsx** - Chart section with H2, caption, toggles
3. **frontend/app/salaries/layout.tsx** - SEO metadata for salaries page
4. **frontend/app/salaries/aiml/page.tsx** - Placeholder for AI/ML salaries explorer
5. **frontend/app/compare/aiml-vs-swe/page.tsx** - Placeholder for comparison page
6. **frontend/app/salaries/search/page.tsx** - Search results page

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/app/salaries/page.tsx** - Integrated new hero and chart intro components
2. **frontend/app/layout.tsx** - Added Google Analytics integration

## BigQuery Integration

Hero stats are fetched from:
```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(ai_ml_median_salary), 0) as median_tc,
  ROUND(AVG(premium_percentage), 1) as premium_pct,
  MAX(month) as last_updated
FROM `jobs-data-linkedin.mobius_analytics_engine.monthly_ai_vs_swe_salary_trends`
WHERE CAST(month AS DATE) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)
```

## Analytics Setup

To enable analytics tracking, add to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Connect toggles to charts**: Pass level/region filters to chart components
2. **Implement search functionality**: Build actual search results with BigQuery queries
3. **Add OG image**: Create 1200×630 image at `/public/og-image-salaries.png`
4. **Enhance methodology**: Add more detailed statistical explanations
5. **Build out AI/ML explorer**: Create detailed salary breakdown page
6. **Build comparison page**: Create side-by-side AI/ML vs SWE comparison
