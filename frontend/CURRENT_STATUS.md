# 🔍 Current Status & Troubleshooting

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Frontend Architecture** - ✅ Complete
   - Next.js 14 with App Router
   - Material-UI theme
   - TanStack Query setup
   - Framer Motion animations
   - TypeScript throughout

2. **Navigation** - ✅ Working
   - Responsive AppShell
   - Mobile hamburger menu
   - Desktop fixed sidebar
   - Page routing

3. **Chart Registration** - ✅ Working
   - Charts are being registered
   - Console shows: "✅ Charts initialized: 4"
   - Registry contains all chart configs

4. **Mock Data** - ✅ Available
   - Mock data defined in `lib/bigquery.ts`
   - Environment variable set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true`
   - Data includes 3 views with realistic data

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Charts showing "Unable to Load Chart" errors**

### Symptoms
- White containers with error messages
- "Chart not found: ai-salary-premium"
- "Chart not found: ai-roles-salary"  
- "Chart not found: top-companies-hiring"

### What We Know
1. ✅ Charts ARE registered (console confirms)
2. ✅ Chart components exist and import correctly
3. ✅ Mock data exists
4. ✅ ChartRenderer is finding configs
5. ❌ Something is failing during render

### Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Added extensive logging**
   - `lib/init-charts.ts` - Shows registration
   - `lib/chart-loader.ts` - Shows component loading
   - `components/ChartRenderer.tsx` - Shows render attempts
   - `lib/data-fetcher.ts` - Shows data fetching
   - `charts/ai-salary-premium/index.tsx` - Shows chart rendering

2. **Created test chart**
   - Simple chart that just displays text
   - No data dependencies
   - Should render immediately
   - Added to `/salaries` page

3. **Created debug page**
   - `/debug` route
   - Shows environment variables
   - Shows registered charts
   - Shows mock data
   - Tests data fetcher

## 🔍 Next Steps to Debug

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open http://localhost:3000/salaries and check browser console for:
- Console.log statements from our debugging
- Any JavaScript errors
- React errors
- Network errors

### 2. Check Debug Page
Open http://localhost:3000/debug to see:
- Are charts registered?
- Is mock data available?
- Is data fetcher working?

### 3. Check Test Chart
The test chart should show "✅ IT WORKS!" if rendering pipeline is working.
If it doesn't show, the issue is in the rendering pipeline, not data fetching.

## 🐛 Possible Causes

### Theory 1: Data Fetching Issue
**Symptoms:** Charts registered but no data
**Check:** Look for data fetcher console logs
**Fix:** Verify `shouldUseMockData()` returns true

### Theory 2: Component Rendering Issue  
**Symptoms:** Test chart also fails
**Check:** Browser console for React errors
**Fix:** Check ChartContainer, ChartRenderer for issues

### Theory 3: TanStack Query Issue
**Symptoms:** Data fetcher hangs or errors
**Check:** Network tab, console errors
**Fix:** Verify QueryClientProvider is wrapping app

### Theory 4: Import/Module Issue
**Symptoms:** Components not loading
**Check:** Build errors, import errors
**Fix:** Verify all imports are correct

## 📊 Test Matrix

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| AppShell | ✅ | Navigation works |
| ChartRenderer | ✅ | Finds configs |
| ChartContainer | ❓ | Need to verify |
| ChartSkeleton | ❓ | Need to verify |
| ChartError | ✅ | Showing errors |
| Test Chart | ❓ | Should show text |
| AI Salary Premium | ❌ | Not rendering |
| AI Roles Salary | ❌ | Not rendering |
| Top Companies | ❌ | Not rendering |

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Clear Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Verify Environment
```bash
cat .env.local
# Should show: NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

### Fix 3: Check Imports
```bash
# Verify all chart files exist
ls -la charts/*/index.tsx
ls -la charts/*/config.ts
```

### Fix 4: Simplify ChartRenderer
Remove all the mounting logic and just render directly.

### Fix 5: Check TanStack Query
Verify QueryClientProvider is working by checking React DevTools.

## 📝 Console Logs to Look For

### Expected in Browser Console:
```
✅ Charts registered in chart-loader: [...]
🔍 ChartRenderer mounted for: ai-salary-premium
📊 Available charts: [...]
✅ Found chart config: ai-salary-premium
✅ Loaded chart component: ai-salary-premium
🔄 Fetching data for view: monthly_ai_vs_swe_salary_trends
📦 Using mock data for: monthly_ai_vs_swe_salary_trends
📦 Mock data rows: 12
✅ Formatted data rows: 12
📊 AiSalaryPremiumChart - loading: false, error: null, data length: 12
✅ Processing data: 12 rows
```

### If You See Errors:
- **"Cannot read property..."** - Component issue
- **"undefined is not a function"** - Import issue
- **"Hydration mismatch"** - Server/client mismatch (should be fixed)
- **"Query failed"** - Data fetching issue

## 🚀 Recovery Plan

If charts still don't work after debugging:

### Plan A: Simplify Everything
1. Remove TanStack Query
2. Use direct mock data in components
3. Remove all animations
4. Remove ChartContainer wrapper
5. Just render basic Recharts

### Plan B: Start Fresh
1. Create new simple chart from scratch
2. Hardcode data directly in component
3. No registry, no dynamic loading
4. Once working, add features back one by one

### Plan C: Different Approach
1. Use static generation instead of client-side
2. Pre-render charts on server
3. Send as images or SVG
4. Simpler but less interactive

## 📞 What to Check Right Now

1. **Open browser to http://localhost:3000/salaries**
2. **Open browser console (F12)**
3. **Look for console.log statements**
4. **Look for errors (red text)**
5. **Check if test chart shows "✅ IT WORKS!"**
6. **Report back what you see**

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see:
1. Navigation sidebar (desktop) or hamburger menu (mobile)
2. "Salary Analytics" page title
3. Test chart with big "✅ IT WORKS!" text
4. Three chart containers with actual charts:
   - Line chart showing AI vs SWE salaries
   - Bar chart showing salaries by role
   - Bar chart showing top companies

## 📸 What You're Seeing Now

Based on your screenshot:
- ❌ Empty white containers
- ❌ Error messages: "Unable to Load Chart"
- ❌ "Chart not found: [chart-id]"

This means:
- ✅ Page is loading
- ✅ ChartRenderer is running
- ✅ ChartError is displaying
- ❌ getChartById() is returning undefined
- ❌ Charts not in registry when ChartRenderer runs

## 🔍 Root Cause Hypothesis

**The chart registry is empty when ChartRenderer tries to access it.**

This could be because:
1. Module initialization order issue
2. Client/server boundary issue
3. React strict mode double-rendering issue
4. Import timing issue

## 🛠️ Immediate Fix to Try

The issue is likely that the registry is being cleared or not initialized on the client. Let me create a fix...
